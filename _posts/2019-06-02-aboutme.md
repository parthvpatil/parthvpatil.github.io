Iâ€™m Parth Patil. I pursued my B. Tech in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I was introduced to programming right in from childhood and have developed a passion for it since then. I have always enjoyed Mathematics and Programming and solving real-world problems using that. I started coding from a very young age. I built my first app in 8th grade and my first custom ROM for my android tab in 9th grade. I was part of the software sub-division of Team AUV-IITB. I was also active in many Technical clubs in the institute. I completed my GSoC'19 with Django Software Foundation. I also did a Research internship with Samsung Electronics.
