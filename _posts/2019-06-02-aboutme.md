I'm Parth Vinod Patil. I'm passionate about robotics and building convoluted software systems. I was introduced to programming right in childhood and have developed a passion for it. I have always enjoyed Mathematics and Programming and solving real-world problems using that. I have completed my B. Tech in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I worked as a Robotics Engineer (L2) at Udaan <a href="/project/vahan">(know more here)</a>. I'm very determined, hard-working, and ready to take up any challenges.
