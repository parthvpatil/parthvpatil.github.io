## About the Project

I worked as a Robotics Engineer in the 'Automation and Hardware' team of Udaan - a B2B Buying for Retailers (Similar to Amazon). We worked on developing a warehouse automation system called Vahan. It is a goods-to-person system comprising a swarm of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). Each robot is capable of lifting up to half a metric ton of load. The robots would typically carry a rack and maneuver it around the warehouse to aid a human in picking the goods, thus enabling faster pick time.

### Multi-Robot Path Planning

<span class="image right"><img src="/assets/images/project/vahan/swarm.jpg" alt="" /></span>In a warehouse setting, multi-robot path planning optimizes the movement and task allocation of a fleet of robots.. Using path planning algorithms, the robots can efficiently navigate through the warehouse and avoid collisions with other objects. The goal of the system is to improve the overall performance of the warehouse by minimizing the time it takes for the robots to complete their tasks and maximizing the utilization of the robots. This potentially leads to increased productivity and efficiency in the warehouse, resulting in cost savings and improved customer satisfaction.

#### My Approach

</div>

<br/>The vahan system is comprised of robots, which navigate with the help of QR codes pasted on the ground. All the robots move in a grid pattern making only 90Â° turns. I opted for a simple solution: I used an entity reservation system to block passage for the robots. The path for any given robot is calculated using D<i style="text-transform:uppercase">*</i> Lite algorithm. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process.

1. A bot is assigned a task to move Rack-1 from point A to point B.
2. The bot first checks whether or not Rack-1 is free for use and reserves that rack.
3. Further, it computes the shortest path from its current location to point A and reserves the whole path. It also avoids already reserved nodes.
4. Then, it moves to point A and picks up the rack.
5. Then, the robot repeats step 3 to move to point B this time.

This approach was designed to be easily iterable. Hence we could do things like swapping the path-planning algorithm, changing the reservation method to reserve partial paths, or creating danger zones in case of hardware failure of a single robot.

### Rotation Controller

#### The Problem

By far, this was one of the most exciting problems we encountered. When the bot was rotating with equal and opposite velocities applied to differential drive, it drifted from the center of rotation in a helical pattern. Despite our best efforts to construe the phenomena, we could not model the physics, which led to drifting, because of which the design of an open loop controller was out of the question. And a closed-loop solution was needed to be implemented.
