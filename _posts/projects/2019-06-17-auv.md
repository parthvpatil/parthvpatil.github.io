## About Team

AUV-IITB comprises of highly enthusiastic and hard working technocrats ranging from bright-eyed freshmen to driven senior undergraduates and tech-experienced post-graduates spanning various branches of engineering like Mechanical, Electrical, Software, Aerospace, Material Science and Civil at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. The team works towards participating at AUVSI Robosub Competition, which is held annually in July at San Diego, California. The competition is a platform for students to display their skills in underwater robotics and build a connection with industries working along similar verticals. The competition demands designing and manufacturing of an autonomous underwater vehicle that can perform predefined tasks. This draws upon expertise of the areas of engineering provided by multifaceted team.Currently we are a 40 membered team developing cutting edge technology for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV).The development of an AUV is a year long process involving design, manufacturing, assembly, testing, integration and competition preparation. In order to accelerate the development of MATSYA our team is structured into three sub divisions viz Mechanical, Electrical and Software.Every year the team puts in 30,000 man hours for the development and integration of our AUV MATSYA.

  <h3> First Year </h3>

  <p>I joined the team in September of 2018, in my first year, after clearing a two stage selection process, which comprised of a written test and interview round. I learned a lot of new things in my frist year as a part of this team, like ROS, git, bash, etc. Here is a list of task I accomplished.</p>
