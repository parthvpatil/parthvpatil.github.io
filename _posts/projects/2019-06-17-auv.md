## About Team

AUV-IITB comprises of highly enthusiastic and hard working technocrats ranging from bright-eyed freshmen to driven senior undergraduates and tech-experienced post-graduates spanning various branches of engineering like Mechanical, Electrical, Software, Aerospace, Material Science and Civil at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. The team works towards participating at AUVSI Robosub Competition, which is held annually in July at San Diego, California. The competition is a platform for students to display their skills in underwater robotics and build a connection with industries working along similar verticals. The competition demands designing and manufacturing of an autonomous underwater vehicle that can perform predefined tasks. This draws upon expertise of the areas of engineering provided by multifaceted team.Currently we are a 40 membered team developing cutting edge technology for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV).The development of an AUV is a year long process involving design, manufacturing, assembly, testing, integration and competition preparation. In order to accelerate the development of MATSYA our team is structured into three sub divisions viz Mechanical, Electrical and Software.Every year the team puts in 30,000 man hours for the development and integration of our AUV MATSYA.

  <h3> First Year </h3>

  <p>I joined the team in September of 2018, in my first year, after clearing a two stage selection process, which comprised of a written test and interview round. I learned a lot of new things in my frist year as a part of this team, like ROS, git, bash, etc. Here is a list of task I accomplished.</p>

#### Databasing with HDF5

This was my first task in the team. The purpose of this task was to get me familarised with the work of our code and ROS framework. The vehicle has four hydrophones, which collects the underwater acoustics data. This data is analyzed in software to locate sound sources inside the water.

The task was to create a program which will take the raw data collected by the acoustics dirver and then convert and store it in the HDF5 database. The idea was to use the compression of the HDF database and save some space while saving the readings. We collected a million samples in two seconds from each of the four hydrophones. This created around 64 mb of raw data, and it adds up quickly if the acoustic program is running for a long time.

Here is the description of the program and my approach. [Internal Link to the file](https://github.com/auv-iitb/robosub/blob/matsya_5_branch/auv_acoustics/src/auv_acoustics/hdf5write.py)
```python
# $Id: hdf5write.py$
# Author: Parth Patil <parthvin@gmail.com>
# Copyright: AUV-IITB 2017

"""
This program writes simple hdf5 files

It takes the bin files i.e. the raw data received from hydrophones
and converts them to text files through fft (present in auv_acoustics)
then it writes the text file to a hdf5file in table format

The module contains the following
Functions:

- 'init' :takes all the agruments recieved and put them in a map
          named variables

- 'runfft' :calls fft and converts the bin to text file
            and saves the final 'YAW' and 'PITCH' in
            final_data and return final_data

- 'lines_infile' :takes the text filename name and returns
                  number oof lines present in the text file

- 'create_file' :opens a hdf5file if it exists or creates a new
                 new hdf5file in /HDF5Files directory and returns
                 h5py.File object

- 'data_write' :take the variables map,hdf5file,and final_data &
                writes the data from the text file to a hdf5file
                and add the final data as attribute to the dataset

```

Overall this was a pretty simple task, but it played an important role in paving my way in the `auv_acoustics` package.

#### Auto Frequency Detection
  <span class="image fit">
    ![Sound signal](/assets/images/project/auv/auto_freq/head.jpg)
  </span>
##### Aim

  The vehicle gets input from the Hydrophones which in the from of a sound wave with respect to time. These wave is a superposition of many waves of different frequencies. The aim was to identify the frequency of the pinger present in the water and apply filters around that frequency to reduce the noise from the surrounding. For this I have to create a program that will detect the frequency of the incoming sound source.

##### Approach

  The method to detect the most dominat frequency present in signal, was to simply take a Fourier Transform (FT) of the signal, then get the Power Spectrum of the FT and then look for the maximum amplitude present in the Power Spectrum.

  The Fourier transform decomposes a function of time (a signal) into the frequencies that make it up, in a way similar to how a musical chord can be expressed as the frequencies (or pitches) of its constituent notes. The Fourier transform of a function of time itself is a complex-valued function of frequency, whose absolute value represents the amount of that frequency present in the original function, and whose complex argument is the phase offset of the basic sinusoid in that frequency.

  The Power Spectrum of a time series. describes the distribution of power into frequency components composing that signal. According to Fourier analysis, any physical signal can be decomposed into a number of discrete frequencies, or a spectrum of frequencies over a continuous range.

##### Implementation

  To implement this, I used the fftw library in c++ and numpy in python.

  <span class="image fit">
    ![Raw Data](/assets/images/project/auv/auto_freq/raw_data.jpg)
  </span>

  I first had to store the data in arrays. The incoming data is discrete , so I used the DFT(Discrete Fourier Transform) functions from the libraries. Then after applying the DFT we get a complex array. Every value in array correspond to the intensity of the component of frequency present in incoming sound source.

  Note:- Since the incoming data consists only of real numbers we  consider only half of the DFT since it would be symmetric. You can read more that over [here](http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/More-DFTs-of-Real-Data.html#More-DFTs-of-Real-Data)

  To find the element in the complex array with the maximum intensity I computed the power spectrum of the data (i.e. basically calculating the modulas of complex numbers). While doing this I realised that in the data, after applying fft and computing power it was found that, there were peak at the very starting and very end of our data. Like for e.g. After applying DFT on 106 data points and then computing power spectrum of 0.5x106 data point the value of power spectrum around 10000 data points at the start and at the end would be higher than that of the actual peak that we have to detect (i.e. the peak corresponding to the frequency of the sound source). So to overcome this problem we can straight away neglect those values since we know that our frequency will not fall in that range

  <span class="image fit">
    ![Power Specturm](/assets/images/project/auv/auto_freq/ps.jpg)
  </span>

This is a code snippet for implementation:

```python
file_path = req.filepath
data  = data_read(file_path)
fft_data = apply_fft(data)
powr_spec = power_spec(fft_data)
filter_intial(powr_spec)
detected_freq = int(auto_freq_detect(powr_spec))
save_data(powr_spec)
```

  Here the `data_read` function reads the data from a file or from a ros topic and return the array of the incoming signal. The `apply_fft` function applies the DFT on the data. The `power_spec` computes the power spectrum of the fft_data generated. And the `filter_inital` set the value of initial and ending conflicting values to zero. And the `auto_freq_detect` find the maxima computes its corresponding frequency and returns it. You can refer the detailed code [here (Internal link)](https://github.com/auv-iitb/robosub/blob/acoustic_test/auv_acoustics/scripts/auto_freq.py) .

<div id="testing" class="tabcontent 2" markdown="1">

  Learning to test the vehicle is important skill that you have to learn as a part of the software subdivision. Testing teaches us that _"Things dont work as we expect them to work"._ The code we write make may seem to be perfect, but once we run it inside the pool along with everything else it may fail. And to win the competition, it is atmost neccessary to have a robust testing system.

<div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;">

  For testing our programs, we first have to run them in simulator and check if everything is running smoothly and there is no breaking error in the code. We call this "Simulator Testing". This ensures that if the code is ran on the actual vehicle in pool it won't do something crazy and damage the vehicle. This step also reduces the time of debugging at the pool as we can quickly, test the programs on our laptop at our own comfort.

  The next step of testing is to take the vehicle inside the pool, and recreate the task environment, to test the working of the vehicle. In this we not only have to learn to debug the software code, but also understand the mechanical and electrical aspects of the vehicle and get a grasp of which component might have failed. This process enhances the understanding of how all the parts in the vehicle work
